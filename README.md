# Data-Science-Portfolio - Julia Robertson
_Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Julia Robertson, a passionate data enthusiast and a budding professional in the field of data analytics and machine learning._

The projects were completed along [my journey to data scientist](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/tree/main/Certificates), and most of them were completed using Python, JupyterNotebook, and R.   

I am enthusiastic about exploring creative applications of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My passion lies in harnessing data to uncover valuable insights and facilitate informed decision-making. I actively stay abreast of the latest developments in machine learning models and technologies. Presently, I am broadening my skills in natural language processing and large language models. I am eager to engage in collaborative projects focused on data analytics, machine learning, and any compelling initiatives centered around translating raw data into actionable insights.

### Data Analysis and Visualisation
- #### R
	- [Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/R/Credit%20Risk/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Logistic%20Regression%20Model.R): Self-developed an interesting topic of finding the customers most likely to default on a loan using a dataset of 30,000 datapoints spread across 32 unique identifiers.

	- [Pitching vs. Hitting](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/R/Baseball%20Analysis/Analysis_Baseball.R): Conducted data analysis using Sean Lahman's baseball database involving over 20 years of comprehensive statistics on baseball teams, batting, and pitching performance, and RStudio to investigate the relationship between pitching, hitting, and team success in baseball utilizing regression models and decision trees. Employed Visio to construct initial decision trees to base rstudio code off of. Implemented predictive modeling to develop a decision tree model.

	- [Chili Analysis](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/R/Chili%20Analysis/Analysis_Chili.R): Exploring the feasibility to privately cultivate and subsequently share seeds from a critically endangered species is the primary focus of this project. The objective is to investigate the capability of private horticulturists in not only growing but also effectively distributing seeds from endangered Capsicum plants.

	- [Short Diamond Analysis](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/R/Short%20Diamond%20Exercise/Diamond%20Analysis.R): A comprehensive analysis of the "diamonds" dataset, covering descriptive statistics, visualizations, hypothesis testing, cluster analysis, and linear regression. Performs various data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks on the "diamonds" dataset from the "ggplot2" package. 


- #### Python
	- [Auto Analysis](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/Python/Auto%20Analysis): Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of auto data comprised of 56,000 datapoints spread across 28 unique identifiers.
	
	- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/Python/Naive%20Bayes%20Model/Credit%20Analysis.py): Utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement a Naive Bayes classifier for a credit dataset. Provides a comprehensive example of training a Naive Bayes classifier, evaluating its performance, and simulating its use on new data in a production-like scenario. The Yellowbrick library is employed for visualizing the confusion matrix, aiding in model assessment.

- #### Microsoft Power BI
	- [Sales Report](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization/Microsoft%20Power%20BI/Sales%20Report.pdf): Overview of Product Management, Manufacturing, Purchasing, Inventory, and Sales for a small embroidery company.

	- [Virginia's EMA Dashboard]( ): An interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI to help the Virginiaâ€™s Emergency Management Agency (EMA) analyze storm damage data for real-time assessments, to assess risk, allocate emergency resources, and respond to media inquiries by providing real-time insights into storm damage, injury, and cost trends during weather events utilizing actual weather data for the state of Virginia.
  


### Machine Learning
- #### Python
	- [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/Julia-Robertson/Julia-Robertson/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Python/Recurrent%20Neural%20Network/RNN.ipynb): Demonstrates the implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series prediction using PyTorch. This provides insights into LSTM model training, evaluation, and the impact of hyperparameters on the model's performance. Additionally, it explores the trade-off between training time and model accuracy by varying the number of epochs.
